### Gitflow

Gitflow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow.

Gitflow is an alternative Git branching model that involves the use of feature branches and multiple primary branches.

#### Step 1

- First step is checkout to `developer` branch and pull the recent changes.

#### Step 2

- üç¥ Fork this repo from `developer` branch and name it! A short, descriptive branch name enables your collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance. For example, `increase-test-timeout` or `add-code-of-conduct`. 

#### Step 3

- üî® On your branch, make ANY reasonable & desired changes to the repository.

#### Step 4

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Commit and push your changes to your branch. 
Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes the commit contains. 
For example, `fix typo` or `increase rate limit`. Note: you don't need to commit every line of your code in separate commits.

#### Step 5

- Before creating pull request you need to check the `developer` branch state! To avoid conflicts, you should merge `developer` branch to your local branch! And resolve your local conflicts. Mini manual: checkout to your local branch and write in console `git merge developer`.

#### Step 6

- üîÉ Create a new pull request using <a href="https://github.com/ita-social-projects/StreetCode_Client/pulls" target="_blank">*this link*</a>.

#### Step 7

- :raising_hand: Assign reviewers! Reviewers should leave questions, comments, and suggestions. After receiving comments, improve the code. Get Approved status on the request and be satisfied with it! 

#### Step 8

- :tada: After 3 approved reviews, merge your pull request with `developer` branch! Also, it is important to wait for your scrum master to approve your changes. If there are some conflicts, resolve them, again.

#### Step 9

- :scissors: Delete redundant branch. Done!

### Hotfixes

Oops, some fixed needs to be done immediately? Use this guide for Hotfixes!

Some fixes will be needed due to the nature of Gitflow. You would have to do a 'hotfix' or something outside of the normal process, but it's simply part of our normal process. 

#### Step 1 

- :fire: To implement an urgent change, a Hotfix branch is created off the `developer` branch to test and implement the fix.

#### Step 2

- :dancer: Once it‚Äôs complete, the Hotfix is merged with the `developer` branch.
