### GitHub flow

GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The GitHub flow is useful for everyone, not just developers.

The main idea behind this model is keeping the master code in a constant deployable state and hence can support continuous integration and continuous delivery processes. Also it is great some smaller teams, just like us.

#### Step 1

- **Option 1**
    - 🍴 Fork this repo from master and name it! A short, descriptive branch name enables your collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance. For example, `increase-test-timeout` or `add-code-of-conduct`. 

- **Option 2**
    - 👯 Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/ita-social-projects/StreetCode_Client.git`

#### Step 2

- 🔨 On your branch, make ANY desired changes to the repository.

#### Step 3

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Commit and push your changes to your branch. 
Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes the commit contains. 
For example, `fix typo` or `increase rate limit`.

#### Step 4

- 🔃 Create a new pull request using <a href="https://github.com/ita-social-projects/StreetCode_Client/pulls" target="_blank">*this link*</a>.

#### Step 5

- :raising_hand: Assign reviewers! Reviewers should leave questions, comments, and suggestions. After recieving comments, improve the code. Get Approved status on the request and be satisfied with it! 

#### Step 6

- :tada: Merge your pull request with master! If there are some conflicts, resolve them.

#### Step 7

- :scissors: Delete redundant branch. Done!
